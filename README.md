"# Nutrition-Profile-analysis" 

Done as a school project, but also with further implementations in mind for the future.
Expect some changes in between the planning and trejectory of the project in between the phases.
However most of the stuff should still be within initial plans for how to conduct the analysis, whilst having the initial hypothesis still in effect.
Some of the methods used to display leaderboard style outputs were intended to verify data consistency and identify potential errors during cleaning/scraping.
They also provided insights for analysis and personal nutritional goal tracking, with the potential to scale into a functional website or application in the future.
